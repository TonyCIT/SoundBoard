1 - Need to add buttons for different load up sounds (54 buttons = 54 sounds) pre-set by me <br>
2 - Should I add the option to record a specific button? or just leve it as a delete sound on that button? <br>
3 - Maybe add option where user can load sounds into the buttons <br>
      3.1 - If yes, how will it afect performance if user loads heavy music? <br>
